    "whup Your Head"

[Chorus:]
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth

Hop up out the bed, turn my swag on
Pay no attention to them haters
Because we whup 'em off
And we ain’t doin' nothin' wrong
So don’t tell me nothin'
I’m just trying to have fun
So keep the party jumping
So what's up? (yeah)
And now they don't know what to do
We turn our back and whup our head and just
Shake em off, shake em off
Shake em off, shake em off

Don’t let haters get me off my grind
Keep my head up, I know I’ll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
Putting it down when I feel like giving up

[Chorus:]
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth

Imma get more shine in a little bit
Soon as I hit the stage applause
I’m hearing it
Whether is black stars, black cars
I’m feelin it
But can't none of them whup it like I do (I)
I get to the mm-yeah go hard
When they see me pull up
I whup it real hard
I whup it real hard
Real hard
I whup it real hard

Don’t let haters get me off my grind
Keep my head up, I know I’ll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
When I’m down and I feel like giving up

[Chorus:]
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth

All my enemies you gon feel it
I'mma do it, do it
whup your head (whup your head)
The fight could be long or short
Do it, Imma whup your head!

All my enemies you gon feel it
I'mma do it, do it
whup your head (whup your head)
The fight could be long or short
Do it, Imma whup your head, your head, your head!

[Chorus:]
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (just whup it)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth (whup it real good)
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth
I whup your head back and forth

<p>
This be my mission/
to beat you into submission/
I've listened to your position/
and noticed it always switching/
That told me something about you/
Namely, I could oust you/
You're intellectly homeless/
Why didn't you take some onus?/
I should've had to do this/
But basically it's done.
You kept playing with words/
I've parted with all puns/
like girls, you just wanted to have fun/
Your daddy should've told you that this world had none/
You chose pleasure like it didn't come with pain?/
Developed a habit in exchange for your brain??/
Were you insane???/
No, that's a crazy question.
You never knew that your mind was my weapon????
